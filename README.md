> Analyzing 3.8 million real Indian news headlines to uncover patterns, trends, and the words that defined a nation.

## What is this?

**india-unfiltered** is a data analysis project that digs into 22 years of Indian news coverage — from 2001 to 2023 — to answer a simple but revealing question:

*What does the Indian media actually talk about, and how has that changed over time?*

This project uses a dataset of **3,876,557 headlines** sourced from Kaggle, analyzed using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Findings

### Education vs Employment Coverage (2001–2023)

![Education vs Employment Graph](visual.png)

- **Education** peaked in **2012 with 1,086 headlines** — coinciding with widespread national debate around the Right to Education (RTE) Act implementation.
- **Employment** never crossed **112 headlines** in any single year across 22 years — despite unemployment being one of India's most pressing issues.
- Both keywords follow near-identical trend patterns year over year, suggesting that **overall news volume** drives individual topic coverage more than editorial priority.
- The **2018–2020 divergence** is the most interesting anomaly — education coverage spiked while employment didn't follow. Make of that what you will.

## What I Learned

This was my first real data analysis project — built while learning Pandas from scratch.

Concepts used:
- Reading and validating large CSV files with Pandas
- Boolean indexing and conditional filtering (`str.contains`)
- Extracting and grouping time-series data (`value_counts`, `groupby`)
- Dual-axis plotting with Matplotlib
- Data annotation and visualization best practices
